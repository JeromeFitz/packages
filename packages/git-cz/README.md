# ü•≥Ô∏è git(moji)-cz => @jeromefitz/git-cz

## üç¥Ô∏è Why this Fork

```bash
npm i -g git-cz
added 1 package in 0.612s
```

Installs in 0.6s vs 31.1s.

### üçΩÔ∏è But Why _this_ Fork

I needed to customize some things, and seemed like the intent was breaking away from [`streamich/git-cz`](https://github.com/streamich/git-cz).

- [x] Package Upgrades
- [x] Node14 Support
- [x] Subject Customization
- [x] Theming: Gitmoji ‚ú®Ô∏è (new default)
  - Semantic Versioning Requirements for CI/CD
- [x] Gitflow Brancing
  - CLI Customizations
- [x] Codestyle Preference
  - Getting there
- [ ] TypeScript Migration
  - Eventually getting there

üìùÔ∏è Note: `@jeromefitz/git-cz-v7.0.0` is the main breaking off point

## üîßÔ∏è Custom config

You can provide a custom configuration in a `changelog.config.js` file in your repo, or in any parent folder.

git-cz will search for the closest config file.

- [Default Config](https://github.com/JeromeFitz/git-cz/blob/main/src/themes/gitmoji.js))

## üößÔ∏è Non-interactive mode

Using `--non-interactive` flag you can run `git-cz` non-interactive mode.

For example:

```bash
git-cz --non-interactive --type=feat --subject="add onClick prop to component"
```

CLI parameters:

- `--body`
- `--breaking`
- `--issues`
- `--lerna`
- `--scope`
- `--subject`
- `--type`

<!-- ## Disable Emoji

Using `--disable-emoji` flag will disable emoji.

For example:

```bash
git-cz --disable-emoji
``` -->

## :octocat: Commit

### Subject via Format

By default the subject format is: `{emoji} {scope} {branchName}{subject}`

```bash
--format "{emoji} {scope} {branchName}{subject}"
```

```json
{
  "commit": {
    "format": "{emoji} {scope} {branchName}{subject}"
  }
}
```

You can configure your own using the following fields:

- `{branchName}`
- `{emoji}`
- `{scope}`
- `{subject}`
- `{type}`

These are the _only_ fields that will be dynamically replaced by `@jeromefitz/git-cz`.

These are not `${type}` so in your configuration if you need to pass dynamically values to `format` you can while keeping these separate. Helpful for when adding ` [skip ci]` to `format` conditionally.

üìùÔ∏è Note: If your configuration file _is_ dynamic and you want to override these change yours at run time to `${type}` üòÖÔ∏è. These fields are only replaced _if_ they exist. Heck, you can have a format of: `format: "static(hard): code value"` if you really want (please do not).

#### branchName

This is really only useful if you are using an issue tracker like Jira.

```bash
‚ñ≤ git-cz [ABC-1234] git-cz
```

Would pull `ABC-1234` in for `{branchName}`

If you were doing something like:

```bash
‚ñ≤ git-cz [feature/gitflow-branch-names]
```

You would not want to pass `branchPrefix` as that would be a long commit message.

Also most likely if you are doing feature branches you are doing `ABC-1234`'s into it.

<!--
üìùÔ∏è Note: If you want to keep emojis in the cli and not in your code commits you can do so by not `disable-emoji|disableEmoji` and not putting `{emoji}` in your format:

```bash
--format "{type}{scope}: {subject}"
```

Have fun in your console if you can't in your codebase. ü§£Ô∏è -->

<!-- ### Theme

`git-cz` provides two themes out of the box:

1. `default` (which is `gitmoji`)
2. `original` (which is "old default" from `streamich/git-cz`).

Themes are an opt-in feature. If nothing is provided for `theme` it will fallback to `default`.

üìùÔ∏è Note: As of 7.x, the opt-in is `default` still but updated to `gitmoji`

#### Default

[gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)

- ‚ú®Ô∏è feat
- ‚ôªÔ∏è refactor
- etc.

You can `extend` this theme by pulling `./dist/gitmoji/index.json` into your `changelog.config.js` and adding, refactoring as you see fit as well.

üìùÔ∏è Note: `chore` is provided as a `git-cz` fallback for those that enjoy using it. Otherwise all "original" `git-cz` => `default` have a 1:1 map to `gitmoji`.

üìùÔ∏è Note: This will override default types along with their emojis.

#### Original

These are the emojis you know and love from `git-cz` available as an **override**.

- üé∏Ô∏è feat
- üí° refactor
- etc.

```bash
--theme original
```

```json
{
  "theme": "original"
}
``` -->

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- No dot (.) at the end.

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

<!-- #### Affects [only on [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) environments]

### Breaking Changes

**Breaking Changes** must start with the words `BREAKING CHANGE:`.

<!-- ### Footer

## Husky

If you are using `husky@5.x` on your project that has `git-cz` as a local dependency please be cognizant of **locally installed binaries**:

> If you were calling directly locally installed binaries, you need to run them via your package manager:

```sh
npx --no-install git-cz --hook || true
```

```sh
yarn git-cz --hook || true
```

- ref: https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=locally-installed-binaries

## Branch

Change the `mode` and create branches via gitflow:

```bash
git-cz -m branch
```

### Roadmap

This is not going to be great to type, but may be good to move to:

- `https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli` and create adapter/plugins.
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è 11.k to 500
  - ‚¨áÔ∏è 373k to 23.9k
